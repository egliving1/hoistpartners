Let me know if you’d like help publishing it or converting it into a CMS template.

You said:
where do i copy and paste this code?
ChatGPT said:
You can copy and paste the code into one of these options, depending on how you want to publish your Hoist Capital Partners website:

✅ Option 1: Local HTML File (for preview or testing)
Open any plain text editor like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text.

Paste the full HTML code.

Save the file as:
index.html (important: use .html extension)

Double-click the file to open it in your web browser.

✅ Option 2: Use with a Web Hosting Platform (to make the site live)
🟦 GitHub Pages (free & good for simple sites)
Create a GitHub account.

Make a new repository.

Upload the index.html file.

Go to Settings > Pages and select the main branch as the source.

Your site will go live at:
https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname

🌐 Paid Web Hosting (like GoDaddy, Bluehost, etc.)
Log into your hosting control panel.

Go to your file manager or FTP section.

Upload the index.html file to the /public_html folder (or root directory).

Visit your domain to see the live site.

🔧 Website Builders (like Wix, Squarespace, Webflow)
These platforms typically don’t let you paste raw HTML for full pages.

If you want to go this route, use them for drag-and-drop builds instead.

Want Help Hosting It?
If you let me know where you plan to host the site (GitHub, Wix, WordPress, etc.), I can walk you through step-by-step instructions.

Click “Create repository”

✅ Step 3: Upload Your Website Code
On your repository page, click “Add file” > “Upload files”

Upload your index.html file (copy the code from Canvas and save it as index.html on your computer first)

Click “Commit changes”

✅ Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to Settings of the repo (top menu).

On the left, click Pages

Under “Source”, select main branch (or master, if that’s what you have)

GitHub will display your site’s live URL like:

https://yourusername.github.io/hoist-website
⚠️ It might take 1–2 minutes to go live.

🧪 Final Step: Visit Your Website!
Type your GitHub Pages URL into the browser and see your Hoist Capital Partners site live.

Want to add a custom domain or logo, or turn this into a multi-page site? I can help with that too.
